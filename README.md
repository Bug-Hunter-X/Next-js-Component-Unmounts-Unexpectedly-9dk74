# Next.js Component Unmounts Unexpectedly

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Next.js component unmounts unexpectedly. The component uses React's `useEffect` hook to log when it mounts and unmounts.  The issue occurs when the component appears to unmount without any clear trigger, resulting in unexpected behavior.  The solution provides a way to resolve this issue.

## Bug

The `MyComponent` in `pages/index.js` is designed to simply increment a counter. However, the console shows that the component is unexpectedly unmounted immediately after mounting.

## Solution

The solution addresses the unexpected unmounting by ensuring that the component's rendering is properly managed within the Next.js framework. This might involve carefully examining the component's usage, ensuring that it's not being rendered conditionally in a way that triggers unmounting, or ensuring the parent component's rendering doesn't trigger an unexpected rerender.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the console logs in your browser's developer tools.
